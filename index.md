#### Author
CT Taber 

## Introduction
The NBA is rapidly evolving in terms of viewership, fan engagement, and revenue growth. However, some franchises are falling behind in competitiveness and market potential. This project investigates the strategic relocation of an underperforming NBA franchise to Las Vegas, utilizing data driven decision making and modern IT tools.

## Background & Motivation
This project stems from the growing conversations around NBA expansion and relocation. With Las Vegas emerging as a major sports hub and the league emphasizing market performance, there's a unique opportunity to propose a model for moving a franchise. Personally, it blends my passion for sports management, wanting to become a GM of a professional sports team (perferably: NBA, NFL, MLB).

## Methodology
- **Data Collection:** Gathered franchise revenue, attendance, social media engagement, and market data & fan data
- **Tools Used:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly.express, Word Cloud), Streamlit, Google Forms, 
- **Approach:**
  - Analyzed Las Vegas’s market appeal
  - Modeled fanbase impact and marketing opportunities
  - Built a dashboard using Streamlit to showcase findings

## Results & Findings
- Survey results showed a divide among fans about keeping a relocating team’s history. Approximately half supported maintaining legacy elements, while others welcomed change depending on its presentation
- Fan engagement preferences leaned toward behind-the-scenes content, loyalty programs, and mobile app integration
- Feedback on ticket pricing was mixed, indicating the need for flexible pricing strategies.
